# Optimizing Food Delivery Routes for 412 Food Rescue

This project focuses on optimizing home delivery routes for 412 Food Rescue, aiming to enhance food distribution efficiency and reduce delivery times. I employ k-means clustering to identify strategic geographic locations for mobile food storage and distribution hubs. By analyzing delivery data, I determine optimal hub placements to streamline the routing process and improve resource utilization.

Using machine learning algorithms and geospatial analysis, I generate actionable insights to reduce route complexity, minimize delivery times, and decrease missed or canceled deliveries. The project also includes a Tableau dashboard for visualizing donor-household relationships and delivery routes.

Key outcomes include a 30% predicted reduction in delivery times and a 13% decrease in missed deliveries. Future work involves integrating these results with advanced route optimization tools to further improve delivery logistics for 412 Food Rescue.
